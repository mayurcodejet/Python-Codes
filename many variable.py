"""
we have seen various types of the variable cases to print the output with same class
now we will see the various variable in one line (not creating diffrent variable for the case)
"""

#how this become possible ? 
#Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line

x, y, z = "Mayuresh","Mumbai", "Student"
#in the python we see in the previous one that the we can save the variable by using the same name but diffrent cases (upper case, lower case, hypion, etc)
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

#one value to print diffrent variable 
x = y = z = "Mayuresh"
#the value is same but the variable is diffrent 
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
#then also it print it
